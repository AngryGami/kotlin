//  Disadvantages: BinaryVersion is a problematic class, because it doesn't represent any logical entity in the codebase, it's just a
//  way to reuse common logic for Kotlin versions. But unfortunately, BinaryVersion is used in a lot of API definitions, which makes
//  code hard to read because it's not obvious which subclasses are supposed to be passed into a particular API.

         *   `76da9df1021 2022-05-26 Pavel Kunyavskiy Bump klib ABI version`
         * - The bump is caused by incompatible change in KotlinIr.proto
         *   `d809e260cb1 2021-10-25 Roman Artemev [KLIB] Support `DefinitelyNotNull` type in KLIB`
         *
         * - Bump 1.5.0 -> 1.6.0
         *   `3403c464fe0 2021-05-26 Roman Artemev [KLIB] Promote library ABI version`
         * - The bump is caused by incompatible change in KotlinIr.proto
         *   `6cdac22a23a 2021-05-26 Roman Artemev [IR] Introduce new IdSignatures`
         *
         * - Bump 1.4.2 -> 1.5.0
         *   `caee17fddb9 2021-04-08 Dmitriy Dolovov [IR] Bump ABI version due to string serialization format change`
         * - The bump is caused by string serialization format change in IR
         *   `50326f019b7 2021-03-30 Dmitriy Dolovov [IR] Use the proper encoding for string serialization`
         *
         * - Bump 1.4.1 -> 1.4.2
         *   `eea5a9102c4 2020-11-06 Alexander Gorshenev Bump klib abi version to 1.4.2 to reflect absence of serialized fake overrides`
         * - The bump is caused by stopping serializing overrides. Normally this would be forwards incompatible change and minor version
         *   should have been bumped, not patch version. But since the code supported the case of fake overrides absence from the beginning,
         *   only patch version was bumped
         *   `cb288d47ea5 2020-11-05 Alexander Gorshenev Don't serialize fake overrides anymore`
         *
         * - Bump 1.4.0 -> 1.4.1
         *   `d7226f49522 2020-04-10 Dmitriy Dolovov KLIB. Promote KLIB ABI version`
         * - The bump is caused by
         *   `101442ad14b 2020-04-03 Dmitriy Dolovov KLIB: Store native targets in manifest`
         *   `1b06256650d 2020-04-03 Dmitriy Dolovov KLIB: Add 'native_targets' manifest property`
         *
         * - Bump 0.26.0 -> 1.4.0
         *   `b06a3ea5acb 2020-03-06 Alexander Gorshenev Print out abi version as a full triple`
         * - There is no clear reasons why the bump was needed. I presume that the author was afraid of version format change. The version
         *   was bumped up to 1.4.0 but not to 1.0.0 presumably because of `isVersionRequirementTableWrittenCorrectly` (It checks that
         *   version is at least 1.4) but `isVersionRequirementTableWrittenCorrectly` is invoked only for `BinaryVersion` (and presumably
         *   only for backend specific metadatas, not for IR) => bump up to 1.0.0 was sufficient. Presumably the author wanted to be extra
         *   safe.
